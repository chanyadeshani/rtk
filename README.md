## Add external libraries for Selenium WebDriver

- Download the Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings for the language of your choice. For this tutorial, we will be using Java.  Downloads are available at: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/.

- Once you have saved and unzipped the Selenium dependencies to your machine:
### Eclipse
- Right-click the Java project created in Step 1 and go to Properties.  
- Select Java Build Path in the left-hand menu and ensure you are on the Libraries tab. Select ‘Add External JARS’ and navigate to the location of your Selenium jar files. 
- Select the 2 Selenium jar files and the jar files in the folder ‘libs’ and click ‘Apply.’

### IntelliJ
Right click project and open Module Settings. Then goto dependencies tab and add dowloaded jars as Jar or directories
